# Dump-Data-by-SQLMap

SQLmap is a powerful open-source tool designed to automate the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. Here are its key features:

Automated Detection: SQLmap can automatically identify SQL injection vulnerabilities by testing various parameters and payloads.

Database Fingerprinting: It can determine the type of database management system (DBMS) in use, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQLite.

Data Extraction: SQLmap can extract a wide range of data from the database, including usernames, passwords, database names, tables, columns, and entire database content.

Shell Access: In some cases, SQLmap can be used to obtain shell access to the underlying operating system for further exploitation and post-exploitation activities.

Custom Payloads and Tamper Scripts: Users can customize injection payloads and use tamper scripts to bypass input filters and WAF (Web Application Firewall) protections.

Support for Multiple Platforms: SQLmap supports various platforms and can be used with different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) and methods (Burp Suite, ZAP, etc.).
